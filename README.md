  Karen, a customer of ours, is opening a new ticket in the ticketing system.<br><br>

  She files the ticket under one of the help topics we previously created:  
  <strong>"Report a Problem / Business-Critical Outage"</strong>.<br><br>

  The issue reported is that the entire online banking system is currently down.
</p>
<br />

  First, we will log in as <strong>John</strong>, who serves as the <strong>Queue Manager</strong>.<br><br>

  Queue Managers are responsible for prioritizing tickets, assigning them to the appropriate departments, and ensuring the correct SLAs are applied.<br><br>

  Next, we log in as <strong>Jane</strong>, the agent we assigned the <strong>"Supreme Admin"</strong> role.<br><br>

  As Jane, we can view and manage live tickets directly within the <strong>Agent Panel</strong>.

<br />

</p>
<p>
  The appropriate <strong>SLA</strong>, priority level, and ticket assignment have been applied.<br><br>

  Communication between the customer and the agent has begun, and the agent is actively working to resolve the issue.

<p>
  The issue was identified and resolved â€” the online banking system is now fully operational.<br><br>

  The ticket status has been updated to <strong>Closed</strong>, and the customer has been informed that the service is back up and running.
